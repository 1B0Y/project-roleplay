# What is Project Roleplay? #
Project roleplay (also known as SourceMode) is a small MTA gamemode project that is designed to show new server owners how Roleplay servers used to be. The project is an open-source based gamemode which is backed up with a MIT license (meaning you can copy, modify and so on).

# What are the features? #
The features will be pretty standard. We're not going with the whole "CnR" "Civilian life" crap. We're going back to old school basics. A list of features will be available soon.

# How to download? #
First, check if there's a version in Source -> Branch. If not, you'll have to opt for a Unstable version of Project: RP.

Download Tortoise SVN, install it, yadah yadah... -> Create a folder on your desktop -> Right click and "Checkout" -> enter "http://project-roleplay.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/" into URL -> Click "OK".
This might take a few minutes depending on how many files and your download rate.

# I found a bug, what do I do? #
Due to not having a Bug Tracker atm, you'll have to message me (britishjack). Click "People", then my name, then email me the bug.

# This is the best gamemode ever! #
